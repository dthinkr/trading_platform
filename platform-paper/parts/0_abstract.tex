\begin{abstract}
We present MINT (Multi-participant Interactive Trading), a platform for experimental economics research enabling multi-participant trading sessions with role-based assignments. The system features event-driven architecture, session pool management, and integration of human participants with algorithmic traders. The platform implements lazy market creation that reduces resource consumption, WebSocket communication, and data collection across over 40 parameters. The system supports authentication methods including Prolific integration for research. MINT enables investigation of strategic interactions, information transmission, and market microstructure effects in experimental environments. The software is provided as open-source to encourage research community adoption.
