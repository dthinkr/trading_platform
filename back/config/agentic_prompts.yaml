# Agentic Trader Prompt Templates
# 
# Each template defines the system prompt for an agentic trader.
# Dynamic placeholders (injected at runtime):
#   {market_state} - current order book, prices, time remaining
#   {goal_progress} - shares completed / total goal
#   {current_reward} - estimated reward based on current VWAP
#   {recent_decisions} - last 5 decisions and outcomes
#
# The prompt should instruct the agent on:
#   - What its goal is (buy/sell X shares, or speculate)
#   - How reward is calculated
#   - What strategy to use
