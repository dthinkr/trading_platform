## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-20 üöÄ **MAJOR SYSTEMIC REWRITE**

This release represents a **complete architectural overhaul** of the trading platform, moving from a complex premature market creation system to an elegant session-based architecture. This is not just a feature update‚Äîit's a fundamental reimagining of how the platform works.

### üèóÔ∏è **CORE ARCHITECTURAL REVOLUTION**

#### **Session-Based Architecture**
- **REPLACED** 356-line `market_handler.py` with elegant 188-line `simple_market_handler.py`
- **NEW** `session_manager.py` implementing lightweight session pools
- **ELIMINATED** premature market creation - markets only created when trading actually starts
- **REDUCED** state complexity from 7 dictionaries to 3
- **SIMPLIFIED** market assignment logic from 120 lines to ~30 lines

#### **Event-Driven Trading Platform**
- **REPLACED** monolithic 558-line `trading_platform.py` with modular event-driven architecture
